Oracle Incremental Merge with Dell EMC BoostFS

The scripts in this section relates to running Oracle Incremental Merge backups with Dell EMC BoostFS filesystem and Dell EMC Data Domain Fastcopy to snapshot and preserve every full or incremental merge backups performed without consuming extra storage on the data domain appliance while providing the ability to perform live mount of such fastcopy snapshots.

This allows a incremental backup with full restore approach for very large databases that run on arrays that do not support Dell EMC Storage Direct (ProtectPoint) capability.
